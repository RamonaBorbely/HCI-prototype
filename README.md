# Self-Checkout Interface Prototype

## Overview

This repository contains a prototype for the self-checkout interface. The prototype aims to streamline the checkout process and improve user experience by addressing identified usability pain points. 
It is designed using HTML and CSS to simulate the self-checkout process, providing a conceptual framework for the potential improvements in the system.

## Features

### The prototype includes three main screens:

- **Welcome Screen:** Greets the user and prompts them to start their checkout process.
- **Scanning Screen:** Allows users to simulate the scanning of items and view their current basket.
- **Payment Screen:** Displays the total and provides a simplified interface for payment options.

## Design Considerations

- **Simplicity:** The interface is kept intentionally simple to focus on usability and ease of navigation.
- **Accessibility:** Large text and high-contrast visuals are used to accommodate users with visual impairments.
- **Internationalisation:** Consideration for language selection to support diverse customer base.
